# Multi Scale Procedural Destruction in Godot

A Godot addon written in C# that generates fragments on startup, and removes these fragments in a customisable way, in realtime.

No knowledge of C# is needed to use the plugin, customise the basic behaviour or create good looking destruction.

# Technicalities / Theory

On startup, each destronoi node creates a binary tree of a specified depth (i.e. the bottom-most layer has 2^depth total fragments). The top level is the mesh, the 2nd level is 2 halves of the mesh, the 3rd is 4 quarters of the mesh, the 3th is 8 eighths of the mesh, etc.

VSTSplittingComponent.Unsplit() searches this tree, and instantiates fragments of a specified depth which are within a bounding area3d (which represents e.g. an explosions) as new destronoi Nodes. VSTSplittingComponent.Activate() does this twice per explosion on 2 different explosion depths and spatial scales, so that the fragments closer to the explosion that are freed are smaller than ones further away (to simulate some level of realism).

If the fragmentation splits the parent fragment into more than 1 segment (e.g. if an explosion happens in the middle of a long beam), VSTUnsplittingComponent detects this and creates however many new parent fragments are needed.

Once fragments are removed, the binary tree(s) are updated, so that any fragments that have been removed have their references nullified. This way the "sum" of the bottom-most meshinstances in any VST always accurately represents the current state of the destronoi node.

There is also some (beta) code for unfragmentation i.e. forming a parent fragment from a list of children (although this is probably a lot less useful than the fragmentation code).

# Credits

I am extremely thankful to seadaemon for the [Destronoi plugin](https://github.com/seadaemon/Destronoi), which this plugin was built off of. If Destronoi didn't exist this project would've taken significantly longer and I may never have made it.

For clarity: my C# code "VSTNode.cs" and "DestronoiNode.cs" were initially a direct port of seadaemon's gdscript code. I then added some functions and different components to each to create this project.

# Dependencies

- Godot 4.4.1+ - .NET version

Note: Jolt is highly recommended when using this plugin. Using the default engine leads to fragments oscillating unphysically (might be something to do with Centre of Mass calculations).

# Recommendations & Performance

For comparison my system is:
- AMD Ryzen 5 5600 6-Core Processor (3.5 GHz)
- AMD Radeon 6600XT (8GB VRAM)
- 32GB RAM

I would recommend using a binary tree depth of 8 (so 2^8 = 256 fragments) as a starting point. This seems to give good looking destruction and has reasonable startup time for ~10 objects (~5 seconds for me).

I would recommend setting treeHeight to e.g. 3 whilst you are making parts of your game that don't depend on detailed destruction. That way you won't waste time waiting for levels to load, but the destruction will still occur (so you'll see if something's broken etc as soon as possible).

I would consider making a manager to set the appropriate debug vs testing vs release treeHeight. e.g. you could add some code to DestronoiNode.cs to get the current game state (debug, full destruction, etc) on ready and set the treeHeight appropriately. Or simply just remove the `[Export]` tag on the treeHeight variable and treat it as a constant - that way you only have 1 line of code to change.

The plugin can deal with many more fragments than what I've suggested above (seems usable at 2^12 = 4096 or even more fragments). There are some issues going this high though
- Some warnings (which are by default suppressed) may occur during startup and runtime. They don't seem to negatively impact the plugin (I think it might be something to do with the Bisect() function finding it difficult to split very small meshes)
- Very long startup time (~15+ seconds even for 1 body)
- If (like me) you are using an area3d to explode objects, by the time the fragments are at say the 8th level, you will have 128 very small fragments that still have 4 levels left. This means that, even for a small explosion, the plugin may be instantiating ~ 100 * 2^4 > 1000 fragments, and godot / jolt cannot do this in less than 16ms i.e. you will drop frames. If you really need this behaviour then perhaps you could come up with a pool system (to avoid needing to instantiate new rigidbodies) and/or if you have a long enough animation, you might be able to spread out instantiating bodies over 10+ frames and you may have a useable system
- very small fragments have a tendency to interact weirdly with characterbody3d's, e.g. launching the player very high

It's important to note that VSTSplitting's runtime is _independent_ of the treeHeight, and only dependent on the explosionDepth requested (i.e. the Binary tree will only be searched to level = explosionDepth). So essentially the performance considerations are 1) startup time and 2) how many bodies godot can instantiate. (Unless my code is wrong ofc. But from my testing this seems generally true.)

# Current Disadvantages / Downsides

- CreateConvexShape doesn't create perfect collisionshapes for complex fragments - e.g. if you have some jagged edge of a body that's just been destroyed, the collisionshape may "smooth over" the spiky bits (sometimes quite significantly).
-> perhaps could create a function which creates a more accurate collisionShape, and not use CreateConvexShape?

- Concave shapes are unsupported (but I don't think this matters that much as concave shapes are to be avoided anyway, except in the case of static bodies)

- No physics / engineering finite-element style simulation, like e.g. Red Faction Guerilla has
-> is there a good estimator for weak points in a mesh?

- It's written in C# which not everyone knows
-> make a gdscript port

## Branch Names

Branch names can follow the same names, but are formatted like
- **`feat/adding-x-from-y`**
- **`fix-enemymeshes/removing-extraneous-faces`**

(as **`:`**, **`()`** etc would have to be escaped and branch names cannot have whitespace.)
