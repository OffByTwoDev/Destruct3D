Note: Jolt is highly recommended when using this plugin. Using the default engine leads to fragments oscillating unphysically (might be something to do with Centre of Mass calculations).

# Commit Convention

## Commit Types

- **`feat`**: A new feature  
- **`fix`**: A bug fix  
- **`docs`**: Documentation-only changes
- **`notes`**: Adding dev-notes / diary entries
- **`style`**: Code style changes (whitespace, formatting, etc. â€” no code behavior change)  
- **`refactor`**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature  
- **`perf`**: A code change that improves performance  
- **`test`**: Adding or correcting tests  
- **`build`**: Changes to the build system or dependencies (e.g. npm, Makefile)  
- **`ci`**: Changes to CI configuration or scripts (e.g. GitHub Actions, Travis)

## Branch Names

Branch names can follow the same names, but are formatted like "feat/adding-x-from-y" (as ":" would have to be escaped and branch names cannot have whitespace).

## Example Messages

```bash
feat(bvh): implement initial bounding volume hierarchy generation
fix(plot): correct axis scaling in star visualisation
docs: update README with usage instructions
build: update python_requirements.txt
```
